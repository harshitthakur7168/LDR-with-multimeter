# LDR-with-multimeter

An electronic component like LDR or light-dependent resistor is responsive to light. Once light rays drop on it, then immediately the resistance will be changed. The resistance values of an LDR may change over several orders of magnitude. The resistance value will be dropped when the light level increases.

**Working Principle of Light Dependent Resistor**


The working principle of an LDR is photoconductivity, which is nothing but an optical phenomenon. When the light is absorbed by the material then the conductivity of the material enhances. When the light falls on the LDR, then the electrons in the valence band of the material are eager to the conduction band. But, the photons in the incident light must have energy superior to the bandgap of the material to make the electrons jump from one band to another band (valance to conduction).

Hence, when light having ample energy, more electrons are excited to the conduction band which grades in a large number of charge carriers. When the effect of this process and the flow of the current starts flowing more, the resistance of the device decreases.

So as the resistance changes the value on the multimeter changes. This the basic priciple behind the auto brightness feature of the phone which changes the brightness of the screen as the we come in the dark or more light than we were previously in.


Here i have used Tinkercad a free online tool to upload and simulate circuits online.

3 different scenarios i have uploaded where the brightness is give at three diffrent levels.

1) Least Bright

2) Medium Light Intensity

3) Maximum Brightness
